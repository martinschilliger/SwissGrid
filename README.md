# SwissGrid iOS App

## Introduction

> Ever wanted to show 🇨🇭 Swiss coordinates on a map on your 📱 iOS Device? Wanted a routing to a coordinate point like 🌍 2'600'000/1'200'000?

SwissGrid is completly rewritten in Swift 4 and wants to be as fast as possible. Like 🏎️. Because you don't want to spend time calculating coordinates, you want to see a map, right? Right 👻.

## You sell it on the App Store, why do you put it on GitHub 🤔?
Good question! If you found it here, chances are good, that you can make it better than I did. So, please do it 👏! If there will anytime be a better app than mine, I would like to use it 🤗! Or feel free to make a Pull Request. And be sure, my ❤️ will make a bump on Pull Request #1.
